	- Right View Warped Background Color Image
	- Right View Warped Background Depth Map
  - Output : 
    - Merged Virtual View Background Color Image
	- Merged Virtual View Background Depth Map
	
</details>

## BackgroundEstimation

Estimate the background through Depth Map, which considers the object distance to camera.
